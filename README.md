# HTML-CSS-JS-Quiz

## Summary

This repo is my submission to UNH Coding Bootcamp's fourth assignment, where we were tasked to make a timed code quiz.

I decided two things at the beginning of the project,  I wanted to store my question bank in an external json file and the quiz will be in one html file.




The deployed project can be found [here](https://thetiiiim.github.io/HTML-CSS-JS-Quiz/).
